Someone send me WannaPIE and accidentally run the script and encrypted all my data. Now i can't recover my home files but luckly i have stat.info of the encrypted files, and i think it would be usefull for you as an cyber security researcher.

WARNING!
Don't run the script unless you have analyzing it and if you do, be carefull of using it. WannaPIE will encrypt your /home data recursively. If you don't want any harm activity, leave it there and try another challanges. We're not responible for any loss of data. Thankyou :)
